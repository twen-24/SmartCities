Abstractâ€”Urban environments produce high levels of noise
pollution due to the constant influx of traffic, construction
activities, and bustling city life. To confront the long-term
impacts of noise pollution on health, this paper explores the
development of a wall employing reflection and absorption
properties emphasized by the structure and material to attenuate
sound. Through changing the curvature of the wall panels, the
absorption and reflection properties of the various panel shapes
were discovered. Of the tested curvatures, data was compiled
and analyzed to determine the optimal curve. The wall consists
of numerous panels on axles that rotate in response to sound
pressure levels indicated by sensors located across the wall.
Beyond a certain threshold, the individual panels will close, but
below this threshold these panels remain open, letting in light.
This aforementioned technology will be incorporated to improve
the mental and physical well being of urban inhabitants.
